## Prerequisites

## Installation Guide

You may need to use `./vendor/bin/sail` in place of `sail` below.

1. Clone the git repository
2. Configure the .env file (copy the .env.example)
    > Set your Hail OAuth credentials: `HAIL_CLIENT_ID` and `HAIL_SECRET`
    > To create OAuth application credentials, these can be found under your Account settings â†’ Manage developer settings.
3. run `sail build && sail up`
    > See **Tip** below if you have port conflicts
4. run `sail artisan key:generate && sail artisan migrate`
5. run `sail artisan oauth:connect hail`
    > Open the URL from the output in your browser and follow the prompts.
6. run `sail artisan organisation:list` to retrieve a bunch of organisation ids and their names
7. Set `HAIL_ORG_ID=` to one of the IDs return from the previous command
8. Run the unit tests `sail test`

**Tip:** You can change the `...PORT...` variables in the .env to avoid clashing with other applications that might be using ports 80, 3306, or 6379 on your host.
Make sure to run `sail up` after making the port changes.
